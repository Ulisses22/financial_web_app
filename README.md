# Financial Web App
That is a financial web application with Bootstrap 5 and Mongoose(Atlas)

- This application consists of performing general management, nothing big, for example, "Money out" means the total amount of money that came out of your wallet, and "Total" is the sum of everything that came in and out, last and not least we have "Balance" here is all that's left.

- For the download icon in the table is possible to download the report in excel.

- To connect NodeJS with the frontend I used the EJS Template Engine.
